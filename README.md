## About SIMP
![Webpage](interface-chopin.png)
SIMP is a web-based prototype tool that allows users to interactively explore and navigate classical piano recordings alongside their corresponding scores.

The project website is at [https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~yjiang3/papers/am23/](https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~yjiang3/papers/am23/).

## Dataset
Our musical repertoire currently contains 54 performances played by 20 world-renowned pianists. The table below shows the specific breakdown of the contents within our database.

|Composer|# of Scores|# of Performers|

|Franz Liszt|2|4|
|Franz Schubert|3|6|
|Frédéric Chopin|5|14|
|Johann Sebastian Bach|6|7|

The digital scores and the performances used were retrieved from the [ATTEP](https://github.com/BetsyTang/ATEPP) dataset.
